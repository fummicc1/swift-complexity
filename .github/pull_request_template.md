## Changes Made

### Core Changes
- 
- 

### Tests
- 
- 

### Documentation

## Testing

### Test Plan
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Complexity analysis on self passes

### Test Commands
```bash
# Commands used to test this change
swift test
swift run swift-complexity Sources --threshold 15
```

## Complexity Analysis

### Self-Analysis Required

- [ ] Complexity analysis run on changed files
- [ ] No functions exceed threshold (15)
- [ ] New complex code is justified and documented

Run swift-complexity on your changes:
```bash
# Analyze changed files for complexity
swift run swift-complexity [changed-files] --threshold 15 --format text

# For comprehensive analysis
swift run swift-complexity Sources --threshold 15 --recursive --format json
```

**Results**: (paste results here or indicate no high-complexity functions added)

**Justification for complex functions**: (if any functions exceed threshold)

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Platform Testing

- [ ] Changes tested on macOS (Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Changes tested on macOS (Intel)
- [ ] Changes tested on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- [ ] Platform-specific code properly conditionally compiled

### Platform Considerations

- [ ] No platform-specific dependencies added
- [ ] Linux compatibility maintained
- [ ] macOS-specific features properly isolated (e.g., swift-format)

## Performance Impact

- [ ] No performance impact
- [ ] Performance improved
- [ ] Performance regression (with justification)
